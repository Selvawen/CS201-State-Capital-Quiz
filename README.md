# CS201-DSA1

This Java program is a simple quiz game that tests your knowledge of U.S. state capitals. It allows you to enter the name of a state, and it will tell you the capital of that state.

How It Works
Initialization: The program initializes a map containing pairs of U.S. states and their capitals.

Display: It then displays the list of states and their capitals to the user.

Sorting: The list is sorted alphabetically by state names using a TreeMap, ensuring that the states are in order.

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the name of a state they want to know the capital of.

Capital Lookup: It then searches the sorted list for the entered state and retrieves the capital associated with it.

Output: Finally, the program displays the capital of the entered state to the user.

Features
